# Greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem
# by selecting the best option available at that instant.
# But greedy algorithm may not get the current best result overall.

# The algorithm can be used with any problem if it has following properties:
# 1. Greedy Choice Property
# 2. Optimal Substructure
